# CS 6250 Fall 2024 - SDN Firewall Project with POX
# build hackers-45
#
# This file contains the rules for the firewall as specified in the Project Documentation.  
#
# Rule Format:
# RuleNumber,Action,Source MAC,Destination MAC,Source IP,Destination IP,Protocol,Source Port,Destination Port,Comment/Note
# RuleNumber = this is a rule number to help you track a particular rule - it is not used in the firewall implementation
# Action = Block or Allow , Allow Rules need to take precedence over Block Rules
# Source / Destination MAC address in form of xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
# Source / Destination IP Address in form of xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx in CIDR notation
# Protocol = integer IP protocol number per IANA (0-254)
# Source / Destination Port = if Protocol is TCP or UDP, this is the Application Port Number per IANA
# Comment/Note = this is for your use in tracking rules.
#
# Any field not being used for a match should have a '-' character as it's entry (except for RuleNumber/Comment)
# Do not pad any of the entries (i.e., have a rule like:  1, Block, -, -,...)
#
# Warning:  For the IP address, you need to specify an appropriate network address
# that matches the subnet mask you are using.  For instance, if you want to use a /16
# subnet mask, then the IP address must be x.x.0.0.  For example, a proper address to 
# reference a 192.168.10.x/24 network would be 192.168.10.0/24.  A single host
# is addressed as a single IP address with a /32.  In other words, the host bit for a 
# subnet other than /32 must be 0.
#
